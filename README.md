# GolfHunterLLC
A site that I am making for practicing making web sites. Will try and use best practices and Sass. It is for a Golf ball with a locator inside that also tracks the flight and tells how far from pin.
I am trying to make a professional looking website for a retail business that is called GolfHunter LLC. My goal is to either sell them this site or to get on borad with their team as a contributing developer...
I have put in some time and effort and at this current commit I have a Home page, a team page, a payment form and am working on the layout.
I have made this a node project and installed npm. Now I will re-iterate throught some notes in order to install express.js. Now we will have a JSON package and I will be 
...able to write some server side script. This will become an app for mobile and a responsive design for laptop or desktop as well. I hope to grow through the building 
of this and use it down the road.
